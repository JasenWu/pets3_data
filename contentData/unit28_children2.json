It may be a case of communicating knowledge ,drawing attention to new issues or entertaining on the basis of science subjects-and there is no reason why the same program cannot combine all three . The essential task is to comnmunicate information.  For that you have to both capture and hold the viewer’s attention.",

This can captivate audiences as effectively as the very best thrillers . Any science subject can make fascinating viewing . As long as the human aspect of science is not ignored . and researchers are not reduced to the role of explaining impersonal data . any subject can make for good television program . The challenge for the producer lies in building a good story around somebody . That does not mean that the story cannot include notions of complexity and doubt , which are necessary features of science . These elements can , in fact , be the most compelling aspect of a science story .",
