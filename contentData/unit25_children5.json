In fact I meet people from places I wouldn’ t even know where to look for on the map .",

You might think that’s a bonus . especially if you’ve got your nose to the grindstone . But you’ d be wrong . Unless you’ve worked somewhere when at times there is almost nothing to do you can’t appreciate the sense of time creeping , the feeling of sleepiness,  the sheer physical dullness in the atmosphere and the sense of something like panic that sets in at the thought of yet another hour of trying to shelve from empty shelves or an hour standing at a desk waiting and hoping for readers to appear.  But that only lasts two or three months until , suddenly , they’re back and the year starts again with its moments of frantic effort and spells of inactivity .",

Most people think of it , when they think of it at all , for it seems to have this reputation as dull , as a nice , quiet almost charming job . Well, think again . At the sharp end it’s hard , heavy and sometimes dangerous work.  And if you  think I’m kidding about the dangerous part how about the risk of heavy metal . very springy , hanging bookend flying out from the shelf into your face which has nearly happened to me more than once or five or six pound book dropping on your head or your foot —both of which actually dio happen to me There are lot of bruises paper cuts —and dust .",
