      "text":"The problem with this young man is immodesty which is fairly common among young people. Some of them have too high an opinion of themselves, totally ignoring other people's, especially old people s, suggestions and advice regarding them as being out of date. Consequently, their immodesty often drives them up against the wall. In fact we should know no matter whom we are and no matter how talented we are we are unlikely to be all powerful and the old people's experience and advice are treasures in our life, which we should try our best to learn from Modesty is one of the many qualities that cross-century young people should possess, It gives us the impetus to go forward .
