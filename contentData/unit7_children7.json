In Henan, nearly every morning, I take soybean milk and baozi as my breakfast. I think baozi, especially those with meat filling,are really tasty. As for soybean milk. I think it contains more nutrition than common milk and is easier for us to digest.  For me, this set of breakfast can provide enough energy for the whole morning, I really enjoy it. ",
