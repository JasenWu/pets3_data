However , it had some social and strategic value for a nation with rising crime rates and commercial interests in the Pacific and East Asia . Britain moved quickly after the American Revolution ended in 1783 to establish its first settlement in Australia , since it could no longer ship British convicts to America , Food shortages , harsh penal laws , and the general displacement of people during the early stages in the Industrial Revolution in Britain added to its criminal population . Leading social reformers of the day asserted that the best way to eliminate crime was to remove these criminals from society . In 1786 the British government announced its intention to establish a penal settlement at Botany Bay in Australia .",

After a brief stay at Botany Bay , Governor Arthur Philip directed the ships carrying “transported” convicts and jailors into Port Jackson , to the north, On January 26,1788, the ships landed at Sydney Cove ,which Phillip named after Lord Sydney , the British home secretary of the time . The new settlement , a penal colony for exiled convicts from Britain , experienced a number of problems . The three major ones are providing a sufficient supply of foodstuffs ; developing an internal and economic system ; and producing exports to pay for the colony’s imports from Britain .",
