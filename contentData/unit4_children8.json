However, some tourists don't pay much attention to environment protection . They throw away waste at will. The litter would do harm to the environment, but it is a relief to know some children volunteers are collecting litter dropped by tourists. They are putting litter into waste bags,which is part of beautiful scenes,too. These children set a good example for us. The picture indicates that every one of us should do something to protect the environment.",
