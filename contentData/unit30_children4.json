            "text": "China lies mainly in the northern temperate zone under the influence of monsoon. From September and October to March and April next year monsoon blows from Siberia and the Mongolian Plateau into China and decreases in force as it goes southward, causing dry and cold winter in the country and a temperature difference of 40 degrees centigrade between the north and the south . The temperature in China in the winter is 5 to 18 degrees centigrade lower than that in other countries on the same latitude in winter . Monsoon blows into China from the ocean in summer , bringing with them warm and wet currents, thus rain . Great differences in climate are found from region to region owing to China s extensive territory and complex topography . The northern part of Heilongjiang Province in the northeast has no summer , while Hainan Island in the south has a long summer but no winter . The Huaihe River valley features four distinct seasons , and the western part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is covered by snow all year round.  The southern part of the Yunan-Guizhou Plateau is spring-like in all seasons;  and the northwestern inland regions could see great variations of emperature within the day . The annual amount of rain or snow also varies reatly from region to region , which is as high as 1,500 millimeters along the outheastern coast , and as low as 50 millimeters in the northwest .",
