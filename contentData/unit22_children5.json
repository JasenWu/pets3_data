Then you would be given a passbook in which your initial deposit would be recorded . All deposits and withdrawals from your account are entered into your passbook . This means that the passbook contains an actual record of all savings you have at any one time . With a regular passbook savings account . you would be able to withdraw money whenever you needed it .All you would have to do is fill out withdrawal order and present it . along with your passbook , to the teller .",

Banks also pay interest at different times . But the majority of them pay semiannually . Suppose , for example , that on January 1, you deposit $1,000 in a bank that paid 5 persent  interest semiannually . By July 1, you would have earned $50 interest . he interest would automatically be credited to your account ; and if you left in the bank . along with your original deposit , you would receive interest on $1,050 for the next six-month period . That is , your interest would be compounded .",

If you go on a vacation or travel on business to another city or state or country , you probably want to bring some traveler’s checks along with you . They have two important advantages over cash . One is that your money is always safe . If the checks are lost or stolen . you can receive refund for the total amount .Another is that they are more convenient . Many businesses are reluctant to cash personal checks on out-of-town banks . But with proper identification , you can readily cash travele’ s checks almost anywhere in the United States or abroad . Every traveler’s check has its own individual number . When you buy these checks (you must purchase at least $50 worth ),the teller gives you a slip on which the number of every check is recorded . A copy of this slip is kept by the bank.  If the checks are lost or stolen ,you can bring this slip to the bank and your money will be returned . Before you are given the checks, you are asked to sign each one of them at the top . When you cash the check , you must sign it again in the presence of the person who gives you the money at the bottom .For this service , the bank charges 1 percent of the amount of the check . If you bought a $50 check , for example , you would have to pay $ 0.50 for it.",
