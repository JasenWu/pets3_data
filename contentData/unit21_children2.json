Most of the central cinemas are around Leicester Square,  showing big blockbuster movies.  You can wander around and see which film is to your appetite.  There’s a lot of information telling you what’s on if you look on the Internet or in Time Out magazine.  But be warned- seeing a film can be an expensive night out in the center of town!",
