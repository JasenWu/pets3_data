Call it the era of trickle-down science : Knowledge emerged from a confined center of rational enlightenment,  then slowly became known to the rest of society . Science  was what was made inside the walls where white coats were at work .Outside the laboratories boundaries began the realm of mere experience —not experiment .",

It has hired researchers,  pushed for controversial procedures like genetic therapy , and built an entire industry,  producing at once new social identity and a new research agenda. In the U .S .,the audacity to challenge the experts , to storm the labs , started with AIDS activists and breast cancer groups ; now it has spread to interested parties of all sorts , from patients who organize their own clinical trials to environmentalists who do their own fieldwork .
