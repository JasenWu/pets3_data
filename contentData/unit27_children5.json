Education of this kind is run by local governments and various business authorities .State-run secondary schools include junior middle schools and senior middle schools , both with three grades or years . The first three years of secondary school are compulsory and tuition is free .Senior middle school is not compulsory and students must pay minimal tuition fees . Private secondary schools often offer specialized education and have a more vocational bent,  but the qualifications they offer are considered to be on the same level as those of State-run middle schools . However , graduates from secondary professional schools are seen to have achieved a higher level in some ways akin to a university education .

Bachelor’s degrees usually require 4-5 years of study ,Master’ s degrees need 2-3 years and Ph . D . s are granted after 3 years . Higher education is offered in universities , colleges , institutes , and vocational colleges . These institutions conduct academic and scientific research and provide social services as well as offering courses to students . To enter a university or college, students have to take the national entrance examination , which takes place every June and is now open to people of all ages.  Selection is based on each student’s marks in this exam , and due to the number of people sitting the exam ,getting into university is highly competitive . Those who fail to get selected have to go to private colleges if they want to continue their education .Tuition at such colleges is more expensive than at the State-run universities .Those who have missed out on higher education can continue their studies as adults in the workplace ."
