He had a very strong imagination and he loved adventure although he did not have many great adventures himself. He wrote a number of exciting books about the things whick he thought that scientists and inventors would one day be able to do. At the time, his stories seemed like fairy stories!",

For example, one book was called From Eartb to Moon.In this book, three men and a dog made a journey around the moon. They did this in a hollow \"ship\" frired from a gun. After going round the moon, they returned to the earth and splashed down into the sea not far from where the first real moon travelers landed in July 1969, about a hundred years later!",
