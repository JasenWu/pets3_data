Pupils now have to behave like scientists in and outside the classroom . They learn to communicate , whether working alone or contributing to a group effort . They learn research skills such as the use of reference materials . They practice gathering and organizing information from different sources . They develop the ability to record and report as well as to translate information from one form to another to suit particular audience or purpose . Familiarity with computers is now essential as pupils are expected to use spreadsheets and databases for collecting and presenting information.",
