We exchanged cell phone numbers and set up a meeting place and time . After hanging up , though ,I began to get nervous . I had known her for a few months , but meeting someone in person is a lot different than chatting over the Internet , and I was worried it would’ t turn out well .",

We talked about graphic design . the classes we were taking , clubs we were in and college , which we were both stressed out about since California schools are so competitive and it’s becoming harder to get accepted into good universities . My parents seemed to have a good time too - my dad got into some incredibly involved science conversation with Kim’s friend Derrick .",
